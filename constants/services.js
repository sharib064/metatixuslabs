    description:
      "Collaborations play a vital role throughout the entire lifecycle of an NFT project, with pre-sale and post-mint collaborations serving different purposes. Pre-sale collaborations are aimed at expanding communities, generating interest in new collections, and building a list of potential buyers. These collaborations often involve Discord alphabot/normall giveaways and Twitter giveaways, where participants complete certain tasks for a chance to win whitelist (WL) spots. The number of WL spots varies, typically ranging from 50-100 in Discord giveaways and 5-10 in Twitter giveaways. Discord collaborations tend to have a more engaged audience from reliable servers, while Twitter collaborations offer a wider reach but with less engagement.",
