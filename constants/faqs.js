This strategy adds exclusivity to your project while also keeping gas prices low during the minting phase, ensuring a smoother experience for users and minimizing fear, uncertainty, and doubt surrounding your project. In essence, each person on the whitelist represents a potential buyer. By distributing thousands of whitelists, Metatixus Labs aims to provide you with a substantial list of prospective buyers for your upcoming project.`,
